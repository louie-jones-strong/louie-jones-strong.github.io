However, one constraint of glassmorphism is that it requires the backgrounds to have well defined edges tohighlight the blur effect from frosted glass. </p><p class="reveal fromLeft">I also took inspiration from the following:</p><ul><li class="reveal fromLeft">Steam's trading card examine effect</li><li class="reveal fromLeft"><a href="https://takeboost.com" target="_blank">takeboost.com</a></li><li class="reveal fromLeft"><a href="http://findmatthew.com" target="_blank">findmatthew.com</a></li><li class="reveal fromLeft"><a href="https://prashantsani.com" target="_blank">prashantsani.com</a></li></ul><p class="reveal fromLeft">I also took a lot of inspiration from some of the websites that I also took code from, as listed in the <a href="#Resources">resources section</a>. </p></section><section id="Accessibility" class="glass rounded"><h2 class="reveal fromTop center">Accessibility</h2><p class="reveal fromLeft">While planning my portfolio, making the website accessible to all users was an important concern. </p><ul><li class="reveal fromLeft">Choice of appropriate design style</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">I have chosen to use Roboto for the font as this is known as being accessible</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">Light and Dark colour themes</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">Scalable font, but defaulting to a large size where appropriate</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">Check contrast of text</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">Check that the entire website can be accessed without a mouse or touch, for example using the TAB key.</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">Provided alt text for all images.</li></ul></section><!-- <section id="Usability" class="glass rounded"><h2 class="reveal fromTop center">Usability</h2><p class="reveal fromLeft">To ensure usability I considered the following:</p><ul><li class="reveal fromLeft">Split content into well defined sections.</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">Test on a variety of device types.</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">Test on a variety of browsers.</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">User testing.</li><li class="reveal fromLeft">Check the website works without java script and CSS enabled.
