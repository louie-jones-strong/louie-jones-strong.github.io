			<p>When Blender 2.8 came out I wanted to learn it for a few reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To get a better appreciation of what the artists I work with do.</li>
				<li>Gain skills in the assets creation pipeline.</li>
				<li>To have a creative outlet from programming at work.</li>
				<li>I enjoy learning new things.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To achieve these goals I set myself the challenge to learn a new system in blender and produce an art work based on that system in only 24 hours.</p>

			<p>This is a hand picked sub set of all the renders I have done as part of this challenge. You can see the full collection on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/louie_j.s/" target="_blank">Instagram.</a>
