				Before I started my University degree I wanted to get ahead of the course to help me maintain a good work, education and life balance. (as I was working full time during my first year of University).
			</p>
			<p class="center reveal fromLeft">
				I knew that a lot of the early modules were going to be tough in JavaScript with some minimal <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
				So the project had to be focused on learning these skills.

			<p class="center reveal fromLeft">
				As I have a passion for making games I felt that a great way motivate myself to learn would be to make a simple website game that I could share with my friends.
