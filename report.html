				<h2 class="reveal fromTop center">Introduction</h2>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft" style="color:yellow">
					Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of
					structure did you choose to implement?
				</p>

				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					For university I had to make a website as part of my web development module.
					At the same time I was wanting a portfolio anyway to show my work and accomplishments.
					So I decided to make a portfolio for this assignment.
				</p>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					My high level goals for this website are to provide a quickly consumable way for people to see if my skills match their needs and be able to contact me.
				</p>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					I then broke down this high level vision into sub-goals:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Provide ways for appropriate people to contact me</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Look both technical and creative</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Show off my skills</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Be quickly consumable at a high level</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Be easily expandable beyond the assignment, and when I create more work</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Have search engine optimisation</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Easily shareable</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Learn new skills</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					As this was my first attempt at creating a full website, I embraced the agile methodology and implemented
					google analytics to give me feedback to continually improve it.
				</p>
			</section>

			<!-- Inspiration -->
			<section id="Inspiration" class="glass rounded">
				<h2 class="reveal fromTop center">Inspiration</h2>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft" style="color:yellow">
					• Inspiration: State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g.
					guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs).
				</p>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					Before starting on the design I researched current <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> design trends:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph" target="_blank">Skeuomorphism</a>
						<p>
							Skeuomorphism is meant to look realistic but needs a large amount of detailed art.
						</p>

					</li>

					<li class="reveal fromLeft">
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design" target="_blank">Flat Design</a>
						<p>
							Flat Design is very simplistic focused on ease of creation and readability.
							This didn't meet my goal of making the site look creative or impressive.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li class="reveal fromLeft">
						<a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/Neumorphism" target="_blank">Neumorphism</a>
						<p>
							Neumorphism is a lower contrast monochromatic style that uses light and shadows to define edges of shapes.
							However, this leads to users struggling to recognise what they can interact with.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li class="reveal fromLeft">
						<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/glassmorphism-in-user-interfaces-1f39bb1308c9" target="_blank">Glassmorphism</a>
						<p>
							Glassmorphism was the newest design trend I found when planning.
							This has less constraints than neumorphism allowing me to define higher contrast to make the website
							more accessible.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					I ended up deciding on using glassmorphism for this website due to it's simplicity combined with the modern look.
					However, one constraint of glassmorphism is that it requires the backgrounds to have well defined edges to
					highlight the blur effect from frosted glass.
				</p>

				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					I also took inspiration from the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Steam's trading card examine effect</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft"><a href="https://takeboost.com" target="_blank">takeboost.com</a></li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft"><a href="http://findmatthew.com" target="_blank">findmatthew.com</a></li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft"><a href="https://prashantsani.com" target="_blank">prashantsani.com</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					I also took a lot of inspiration from some of the websites that I also took code from, as listed in the <a href="#Resources">resources section</a>.
				</p>

				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					Once I decided on my vision for the website (<a href="#MockUps">See design mock-ups for more info</a>)
				</p>
			</section>

			<!-- Accessibility -->
			<section id="Accessibility" class="glass rounded">
				<h2 class="reveal fromTop center">Accessibility</h2>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft" style="color:yellow">
					• Accessibility: State 3 ways in which your site is accessible to those with different
					abilities and needs (for example those with visual impairment)
				</p>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					While planning my portfolio, making the website accessible to all users was an important concern.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Choice of appropriate design style</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">I have chosen to use Roboto for the font as this is known as being accessible</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Light and Dark colour themes</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Scalable font, but defaulting to a large size where appropriate</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Check contrast of text</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Check that the entire website can be accessed without a mouse or touch, for example using the TAB key.</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Provided alt text for all images.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<!-- Usability -->
			<section id="Usability" class="glass rounded">
				<h2 class="reveal fromTop center">Usability</h2>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft" style="color:yellow">
					• Usability: State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Split content into well defined sections</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Test on a variety of device types</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Test on a variety of browsers</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">User testing</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Ideally I would make sure my website worked without java script and CSS enabled, however that is
						something I plan to address at a later date.</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Saving user preferences to local storage</li>

			<!-- Learning -->
			<section id="Learning" class="glass rounded">
				<h2 class="reveal fromTop center">Learning</h2>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft" style="color:yellow">
					• Learning: state 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did
					you achieve that?
				</p>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					In order to learn about integrating with other APIs, and to facilitate further learning, I decided to use
					Google Analytics. This should provide me with a better understanding of how users respond to the website.
				</p>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					Some of the main web-skills I learnt from doing this project were
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">JQuery - This was used for the header footer and loading screen</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Typography - I found a particularly useful website fot this,  </li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft"><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr></li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">JavaScript <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> manipulation</li>
					<li class="reveal fromLeft">Managing timescales of creative and learning tasks</li>
				</ul>

			<!-- Evaluation -->
			<section id="Evaluation" class="glass rounded">
				<h2 class="reveal fromTop center">Evaluation</h2>

				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					I am very happy with the website I have made, especially given the limit understanding of html, css and JavaScript I had at the start of this module.
				</p>

				<h3 class="reveal fromLeft">What Went Well</h3>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft" style="color:yellow">
					• Evaluation I: What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful?
					Why?
				</p>

				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					I am proud of the design of the website I feel it has met my goals set out in the introduction.
					I am surprised with the amount of content I was able to produce in a small amount of time.
					Based on this I feel I have successfully managed the scope and time of this project.
					I've learnt how to make a responsive website that accommodates a diverse set of users with differing accessibility needs.

					To speed up my workflow for this website and future websites I created a tool in python that resizes all images and videos in a directory structure.
				</p>

				<h3 class="reveal fromLeft">What Could have Gone Better</h3>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft" style="color:yellow">
					• Evaluation II: What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do
					things differently another time?
				</p>

				<p class="reveal fromLeft">
					One large mistake I made early on was developing the website on a 4k monitor, this meant that it didn't look like how I expected at lower screen resolutions.
					I ended up having to redo a lot of the html and css to work at lower resolutions.
					When making my next website I would continually test each change on each aspect ratio.


					I would have liked more time to be able to impliment more content, such as my work experience and group projects.However I have designed this website to be easily editable and I am planning to add tese projects along with any future ones to this portfolio soon.


					I should've asked for feedback on my initial plans before creating the webpage as this would've saved me a lot of time.
					I should've spent more time optimising loading times especially for the 24 hour blender challenges.

			<!-- Resources -->
			<section id="Resources" class="glass rounded">
				<h2 class="reveal fromTop center">Resources</h2>
				<p class="reveal fromLeft" style="color:yellow">
					• Resources: What resources did you use in your work? List any sources of
					information, libraries, plugins, code, or tools (you should also indicate inclusions
					from other sources within your code using comments)

					• Appendices: Site map, wireframes, and mock-ups
